# Project 1 - Belinda Gao
## My STATS 220 Journey Starts Here!

*I'm excited to learn more about coding and programming languages. I hope I can meet more people as I learn, too.*
### Here are some facts about me so you can know me a bit more:
1. I am from China and I have been studying in New Zealand since 2015.
2. I am studying international business and psychology at UOA and currently studying offshore.
3. Here are the top 40 singles in New Zealand the week I was born, [Click here](https://nztop40.co.nz/chart/singles?chart=1071) to find out with me.

### And here are some tips I've prepared for myself from my previous learning experiencesï¼š
* Finish watching the recordings of lectures ASAP.
* Communicate with classmates and teachers more while I'm still learning offshore.
* Spent more time on more meaningful things instead of entertainment.

**Let's have a perfect semester together!!**
